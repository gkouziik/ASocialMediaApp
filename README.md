A social media app with MERNG Stack
The current app is a social media app with MongoDb, React, Express, Node.js, and GraphQL
The structure of this app is taken from [FreeCodeCamp youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1mdAPFq2Os&t=3396s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
With the following extra features added by me:

* Email Integration(forgot password, confirm account)
* Profile View(user's can click on each others profiles and "follow" them)
* Profile Edits(users can upload information about themselves: email, website, "about me" etc)
* Edit Posts(users can edit their posts)
* File uploads(allow users to upload images, and videos, etc)
*Custom css
